# ♾ Organization

Everyone who owns an NFT from the MxGhosts Collection is eligible to create a proposal and vote for the DAO decisions.

Every day, the members come up with fresh ideas! We discuss, vote on and implement them.

## Easy way

The Gokai Labs team loves creating and interacting with their community.

There’s plenty of stuff coming up like collector Voxel, Comic and 3D NFTs or SFTs. 3D-printed, T-shirts, stickers, and more are growing here.

Our app is bound to evolve, add a tracking dashboard, add a formal rarity system and plenty of other cool stuff.

## **Road to MultiversX validator**

### DAO members are unanimous. ****&#x20;

Launching a node and becoming a staking provider is the path to take. A node will always keep running, no matter what.

### Why is this important?

In Asia**,** there are only 6% of MultiversX nodes in activity. We are the perfect organization to be a part of the security of the MultiversX network in Asia.

### It's not impossible!

We're currently 2360 EGLD short of this goal. 7439 NFTs are still to be minted. That means we'll need to hit a median mint price of 0.32 EGLD.

## **Road to DAO**

What we love about web3 is its decentralization. Decentralization allows a lot of people around the world to run an organization. And it needs a few tools.

### An open-source application

An open-source application is needed that allows developers to contribute and maintain it.

### A governance system

Governance is already active on Superciety.

### A multi-sig wallet

The multisig wallet will be enabled when xSafe’s Multisig system goes live.

## More roads&#x20;

Several ideas have already surfaced as to what the next step could be.&#x20;

Everything comes down to the votes of the members who make the decisions.
{% endhint %}

### Play2Earn

We’ve yet to unleash our full creative power. We want to create a gameplay experience to be as immersive and engaging as possible.

### Staking

Staking is a requested feature that we could add, although passive income alone might be appropriate.

### Charity&#x20;

There are many charitable organizations in Thailand. One is one we want to help, the Soi Dog Foundation in Phuket, helping homeless dogs.

### Ecological project

We have a lot of palm oil fields in Thailand. It is possible to exploit their full potential while improving biodiversity.

### Cannabis farm&#x20;

In Thailand, cannabis just got legalized. We are already registered growers. This could be a significant stream of revenue.

### Coffee Shop

We're looking to open up a new kind of crypto coffee shop with discounts for those who pay with the Maiar wallet and benefits for NFT holders.

### Comic strip

We know it comes down to this. And we're about to surprise you at this one point.

## No way

We are not planning a second collection; this collection will be one-of-a-kind! Members can only receive collector's NFTs.

We are not planning ESDT tokens for now because we don't think they add any value.
